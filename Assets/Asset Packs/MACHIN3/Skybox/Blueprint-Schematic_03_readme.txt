Thanks for your purchase!

This package contains one Skybox design, which comes in 10 tasteful, carefully crafted color variations.

The skyboxes are perfectly seamless. They wrap a background around the viewer and resemble a blueprint or schematic, a pseudo technical drawing board if you want. This is perfect, if you want to present assets/units in your game or application, such as on a unit customization screen, or a tech screen, etc. 

The textures are provided in .psd format for 2 reasons: 
1. it's lossless 
2. you can change or remove labels/typographic elements easily, as they are kept on seperated layers.

The textures are provivided in cubemap format for ease of use. Each side of the cubemap is 2k in resolution. 

To select a skybox in Unity, go to Window -> Lighting and select one of the Blueprintxx_xx materials at the top under "Environment Lighting > Skybox". Make sure you have the skybox toggle in your scene view turned on.

Should you need a custom color variation, that is beyond what you can do with the provided .psd files, please get in touch with support@machin3.io so we can create a unique variation in exchange for a small fee.

Enjoy and good luck with your projects!
